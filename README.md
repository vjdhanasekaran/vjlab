# Pathogen Evolution lab

This site was developed based on source code from Trevor Bedfords's website [bedford.io](http://bedford.io).

## Build site

To build the website locally, clone the repo:

```
https://github.com/vjlab/vjlab-website
```

Then install necessary Ruby dependencies by running `bundle install` from within the `vjlab-website` directory.  After this, the site can be built with:

```
jekyll build
```

To view the site, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and point a browser to `http://localhost:4000/`. More information on Jekyll can be found [here](http://jekyllrb.com/).
